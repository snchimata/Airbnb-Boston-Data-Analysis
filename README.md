[Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) is the recommended distribution, a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries or [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) can be utilized for the project. 


## Project Motivation

To explore messy real-world data and come up with valued business questions that could be answered by data science skills.
Use visualizations to make findings more understandable and catchy.
Communicate with stakeholders from different backgrounds addressing the following questions

1. Predict the sentiment score for user comments

2. Assess relation between review score rating, number of reviews and price

3. Identify Most important attributes emphasized by hosts and required for tenants

4. Predict the monetary value of rental based on listing information

5. Identify Prominent features to affect the rental price


## File Descriptions 

There are three CSV files of Boston Airbnb data and a ipynb notebook with exploratory data analysis, sentiment analysis, to Modeling and feature importance etc.
1. calendar - Price and availability of each Airbnb house.  
2. listings - Title, description, Amenities, ratings, layouts and everything about each AirBNB house. 
3. reviews - Data related to comments by guests
4. Airbnb-Boston-Data-Analysis.ipynb - Notebook with data-driven analysis
